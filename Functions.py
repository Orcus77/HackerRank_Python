#The end=” “ is used to print in the same line with space after each element. It prints a space after each element in the same line.
#The end=”” is used to print on same line without space. Keeping the doube quotes empty merge all the elements together in the same line.
#The end=”,” is used to print in the same line with a comma after each element. We can use some other sign such as ‘.’ or ‘;’ inside the end parameter.
